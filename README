Git general info:
- Will NOT be using Shared server (afp://od1/Projects) for master version
- Will be using Shared server for master version backup (to be discussed later)
- Each developer will have access to the Git repository
- Each developer will need to clone the remote repository to their local machine:

	% git clone https://github.com/nrkefauver/CSE5911_AnatomyApp.git

	- This clone will only exist on the machine you clone it to
	- If using a different machine, you MUST clone the repository again


DO:
- DO use meaningful commit messages, file names, variable names
- DO update readme with brief explanation about EVERY commit
	- Include name, date, time, explanation


DO NOT (without consent from rest of team):
- DO NOT rename or delete files
- DO NOT commit temporary files
- DO NOT force commits to dev branch


Process to add new changes:
1. Make sure you are in the project directory

2. Pull any new changes made by other team members to local:

	% git pull

3. Make any changes / additions to your local clone.

4. Commit changes (local):

	% git add TestFile.h
	OR
	% git add *
	THEN
	% git commit

5. This will bring up Vim text editor.  Add your commit message to the top (You should see INSERT) at the bottom of the page.  Once finished with your commit message, hit ESC, then type :x to save and close Vim.

6. Push commit to remote repository under your branch:

	% git push https://github.com/nrkefauver/CSE5911_AnatomyApp.git (myBranch)
	WHERE myBranch is the name of your specified branch (Example: bjl)

5. Fix any merge conflicts created (unlikely).  See the Git tutorial to see how this works.


Convention:
- Use “Camel Case” for class names / variables
	Example class name: TestClass.h
	Example variable name: testVarible
- Use “// TODO” to indicate more work is to be done at a later time
