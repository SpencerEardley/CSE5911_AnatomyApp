********** STANDARDS **********
Git general info:
- Will NOT be using Shared server (afp://od1/Projects) for master version
- Will be using Shared server for master version backup (to be discussed later)
- Each developer will have access to the Git repository
- Each developer will need to clone the remote repository to their local machine:

	% git clone https://github.com/nrkefauver/CSE5911_AnatomyApp.git

- Each developer will need to switch to their own branch after cloning:

	% git checkout (myBranch)
	WHERE myBranch is the name of your branch (Example: bjl)

- This clone will only exist on the machine you clone it to
- If using a different machine, you MUST clone the repository again and switch to your branch!


DO:
- DO use meaningful commit messages, file names, variable names
- DO ask for consent from team before pushing any commits to dev
- DO use Xcode source control features (pushing, pulling, merge conflicts)

DO NOT (without consent from rest of team):
- DO NOT rename or delete files
- DO NOT commit temporary files
- DO NOT force commits to dev branch
- DO NOT commit changes to Main.storyboard without consent from rest of team


Process to add new changes TO YOUR BRANCH:
1. Make sure you are in the project directory and on your branch.
	- To see which branch you are on: % git branch
	- To switch to your branch: % git checkout (myBranch)

2. Pull any new changes made by other team members from master to your branch:
	*** If you have any uncommitted changes to your branch, commit them to your branch now! ***

	% git rebase master

	- Your branch should be up to date with master now

3. Make any changes / additions to your local clone on your branch.

4. Commit changes to your branch:

	% git add TestFile.h
	OR
	% git add *
	THEN
	% git commit 

5. This will bring up Vim text editor.  Add your commit message to the top (You should see INSERT) at the bottom of the page.  Once finished with your commit message, hit ESC, then type :x to save and close Vim.

6. Push commit to remote repository under your branch:

	% git push origin (myBranch)
	WHERE myBranch is the name of your specified branch (Example: bjl)

7. Fix any merge conflicts created (unlikely).  See the Git tutorial to see how this works.


Convention:
- Use “Camel Case” for class names / variables
	Example class name: TestClass.h
	Example variable name: testVarible

- Use “// TODO” to indicate more work is to be done at a later time
