	<key>Anterior corticospinal tract</key>
	<string>Small bundle of descending axons connecting the cerebral cortex to the spinal cord. The tract is located in close proximity to the anterior median fissure and is not present below the thoracic region of the spinal cord. Unlike axons of the lateral corticospinal tract, axons within the anterior corticospinal tract do not cross over in the medulla, but descend on the ipsilateral side of the spinal cord until close to the region of synapse and then the axons cross to the contralateral side. Neurons within the cerebral cortex often project bilaterally within the anterior cortical spinal tract to synapse with neurons within the anterior horn of gray matter responsible for innervating axial muscles. </string>
	<key>Anterior spinothalamic tract</key>
	<string>Also referred to as the ventral spinothalamic system, this spinal tract is responsible for carrying crude touch and firm pressure information from the periphery. The tract consists of axons from second order neurons from the contralateral side of the spinal cord. The axons within the tract ascend the spinal cord and synapse with third order neurons within the thalamus (VPL) and reticular formation.</string>

	<key>Dorsal Column-Medial Lemniscus System</key>
	<string>Ascending tract responsible for convey fine touch, vibration and conscious proprioception from the periphery. The dorsal column of white matter inferior to T6 is organized into one group called the fasciculus gracilis. Superior to T6 the dorsal column is divided into the fasciculus gracilis (medially) and the fasciculus cuneatus (laterally). All first order sensory axons responsible for relaying fine touch, vibration and conscious proprioception at T6 and below enter the spinal cord and ascend within the fasciculus gracilis. All first order sensory axons responsible for relaying fine touch, vibration and conscious proprioception above T6 enter the spinal cord and ascend within the fasciculus cuneatus. Axons within each fasciculus ascend on the ipsilateral side of the spinal cord until reaching their respective nucleus within the caudal medulla. The axons of the second order neurons cross to the contralateral side of the brainstem within a group of axons called the medial lemniscus, which synapse with third order neurons within the thalamus. </string>
	<key>Dorsal horn of gray matter</key>
	<string>This column of gray matter is formed mainly by interneurons, afferent projection nuclei, and central neuroglia. Sensory information from the periphery is relayed from the afferent nuclei in the dorsal root ganglia to synapse with the afferent nuclei within the dorsal gray horn. Two prominent parts of the dorsal horn of gray mater are the substantia gelatinosa and the body of the dorsal horn. This section of the spinal cord in the adult is derived from the embryological alar plates.</string>

Axons relaying this sensory information synapse with Clarke’s nucleus. Axons from Clarke’s nucleus project to a portion of the lateral funiculus, which is the organized dorsal spinocerebellar tract. These axons enter the cerebellum through the inferior cerebellar peduncle and terminate within the ipsilateral side of the cerebellum, thus no part of this tract crosses to the contralateral side. Clarke’s nucleus does not extend below the L3 spinal cord level, and thus neither does the dorsal spinocerebellar tract.</string>
