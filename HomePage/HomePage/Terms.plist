		<string>Anterior corticospinal tract</string>
		<string>Small bundle of descending axons connecting the cerebral cortex to the spinal cord. The tract is located in close proximity to the anterior median fissure and is not present below the thoracic region of the spinal cord. Unlike axons of the lateral corticospinal tract, axons within the anterior corticospinal tract do not cross over in the medulla, but descend on the ipsilateral side of the spinal cord until close to the region of synapse and then the axons cross to the contralateral side. Neurons within the cerebral cortex often project bilaterally within the anterior cortical spinal tract to synapse with neurons within the anterior horn of gray matter responsible for innervating axial muscles. </string>

		<string>Dorsal Column-Medial Lemniscus System</string>
		<string>Ascending tract responsible for convey fine touch, vibration and conscious proprioception from the periphery. The dorsal column of white matter inferior to T6 is organized into one group called the fasciculus gracilis. Superior to T6 the dorsal column is divided into the fasciculus gracilis (medially) and the fasciculus cuneatus (laterally). All first order sensory axons responsible for relaying fine touch, vibration and conscious proprioception at T6 and below enter the spinal cord and ascend within the fasciculus gracilis. All first order sensory axons responsible for relaying fine touch, vibration and conscious proprioception above T6 enter the spinal cord and ascend within the fasciculus cuneatus. Axons within each fasciculus ascend on the ipsilateral side of the spinal cord until reaching their respective nucleus within the caudal medulla. The axons of the second order neurons cross to the contralateral side of the brainstem within a group of axons called the medial lemniscus, which synapse with third order neurons within the thalamus. </string>
